"""The thin, stubbable LLM boundary every generation stage calls through.

Mirrors the grader's ``JudgeClient`` pattern (see ``grade/judge.py``): all the
nondeterminism and network I/O of generation lives behind a single
``complete(prompt, *, temperature) -> str`` method. The deterministic logic
around it — prompt assembly, response parsing, and composing the three stage
outputs into a renderable site — is therefore fully testable with
:class:`StubGenerationClient` and **no live API call**.

The real :class:`AnthropicGenerationClient` is import-safe (the ``anthropic`` SDK
is imported lazily) and is only used when explicitly injected. Generation uses a
single model — **Opus 4.6** — across all three stages, with the per-stage
temperature passed in by the caller (1.0 / 0.7 / 0.6 for stages 1/2/3).
